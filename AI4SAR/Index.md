1. Move the entire search operation to a computer-based system where information is collected in a database in real-time, improving productivity, the flow of information and ultimately, search outcomes

3. Apply AI to the Enriched Data to Improve Search Outcomes

	- We want a flexible solution to plug in more and more components.
- Distill fountain of data into human comprehensible
	- Into plans + facts of interesting data
	- So human equivalents can have
	- Resource management person
